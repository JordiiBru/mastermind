# Mastermind Board Game
##Introduction
Welcome to the Mastermind game project! This Java-based application is designed using a three-tier architecture and offers a classic code-breaking experience. This README provides essential information for understanding and using the Mastermind application.

## Project Structure
The project directory is organized into three main folders:

### ASSETS
This directory contains images used for the graphical user interface (GUI) of our application.

### DOCS
Here, you will find all the necessary documentation related to the project. Each subdirectory may have its own index.txt file explaining its contents.

### EXE
The EXE directory holds the essential files and locations for executing tests and drivers. If there are no .class files in this directory, it means you need to compile them first from the FONTS directory.

### FONTS
All source code files for the Mastermind implementation are stored in this directory. You can find detailed instructions on how to compile the project in the index.txt file within this directory.

## Compilation
To compile the project, navigate to the FONTS directory and follow the instructions provided in the index.txt file. This step is essential before executing any tests or drivers.

## Running Tests and Drivers
To run unit tests or drivers, go to the EXE directory. You will find an index.txt file with all the necessary information for execution. Note that if the EXE folder is empty, you must compile the project first from the FONTS directory.

## Gameplay
To play the Mastermind game, after successfully compiling the project using the make.sh script in the FONTS directory, navigate to the EXE directory and execute the play.sh script. The provided scripts are configured for Linux environments.

The scripts and classes (drivers) contain explanatory messages to help guide you through the execution process.

Enjoy playing Mastermind and have fun breaking the secret code!
